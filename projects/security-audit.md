# Security Audit

I conducted a security audit for a small business as part of my cybersecurity certificate program. The audit involved assessing the companyâ€™s network for vulnerabilities, such as outdated software and weak password policies. I identified risks like unpatched systems that could be exploited by attackers and proposed solutions, including implementing regular patch management, enforcing strong password policies, and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.

**Tools Used:** Nmap for network scanning, Nessus for vulnerability assessment  
**Outcome:** The business adopted my recommendations, reducing their risk profile significantly.
